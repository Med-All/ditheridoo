# MegaPixel

MegaPixel is a multicolor bitmap editor for Commodore 64.



# Getting Started

MegaPixel comes in two flavours:

- standalone executable for 64-bit systems Linux, MacOS/Darwin and Windows
- Python3 script

## Standalone executable

Just download your bundle and enjoy.


## Python3 script prerequisites

As MegaPixel is written in Python3 it depends a little on which OS you are starting it.
On Linux and Mac OS you might want to install needed modules first (see Prerequisites).
On Windows you may want to use the contents of the ZIP file and start the .exe.

At least this is needed to run the script directly:

- python 3
- python tkinter module
- python "The Python Imaging Library" (PIL)

On my Debian machine I use apt-get to install everything needed:
```
apt-get update
apt-get install python3 python3-tk python3-pil
```
